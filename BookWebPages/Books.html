                A competing financial self-help writer, John T. Reed, says, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad contains a large amount wrong advice, much bad advice, and virtually no good advice." He also states, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad is one of the dumbest financial advice books I have ever read. It contains many factual errors and numerous extremely unlikely accounts 
                of events that supposedly occurred."[12]

                Slate reviewer Rob Walker called
                 the book full of nonsense, and said that Kiyosaki'
                 s claims were often vague, the narrative "fablelike", 
                 and that much of the book was "self-help boilerplate", 
                 noting the predictable common features of such books were 
                 present in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. He also criticizes Kiyosaki's
                  conclusions about Americans, American culture, and Kiyosaki's methods.

                Covey coined the term abundance mentality, or abundance mindset, 
                a way of thinking in which a person believes there are enough resources 
                and successes to share with others. He contrasts it with the scarcity mindset
                which is founded on the idea that if someon
                 e else wins or is successful in a situation,
                 it means "you lose", because you are not considering the possibility of all parties "winning" in some way or another in a given situation.

                Individuals having an abundance mentality seek win-win scenarios, avoiding the notion of 
                zero-sum games, and are able to celebrate the success of others, rather than feel threatened by them. The
                    author contends that the abundance mentality arises from having a high self-worth and security  and 
                    leads to the sharing of profits, recognition and responsibility. Similarly, organizations may also apply an abundance mentality 
                    when doing business.
